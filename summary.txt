Notes on Joe's files
Updated 2/28/19

1. MC10 sensor project for CVA
Relevant files should be here: \\FS2.smpp.local\Lab Members\JoeL
All Python notebooks and relevant files should be in the GitHub directory here:
    \\FS2.smpp.local\Lab Members\JoeL\GitHub

GitHub repo
https://github.com/kamshee/MC10sensors
`dump` directory - Dumped code here instead of deleting.
    Tested some things like HC01 and HC02 (which had battery issues and 
    missing data), clipping and aggregating functions (later decided we were not 
    going to clip and do sliding windows and get features from them), Andrew Dai's
    code looking at PSD binning for features, 
`meetings` directory - Added notebooks on feature discussion and length of stay (LOS)
    data visualization.
`tests` directory - Included some testing including 131 features from Megan's previous
    paper to compare the results of the features translating Matlab to Python code.
`machinelearning` directory - Examples of simple models (knn, logreg, SVM) using 
    Pipeline objects, hyperparameter tuning with cross validation, splitting train/test
    datasets, scoring, predicting, and reporting. The current plan is to use autosklearn
    to build and test different ML models.
`computervision` directory - Includes Ami's Matlab scripts using computer vision for
    signal processing and preparing for better feature engineering. We may apply DTW
    after. The 131 features from Megan may also be used later on to plug into the ML
    models. It'll depend on the results.
    Note the path on drive: \\FS2.smpp.local\Inpatient Sensors -Stroke\Data analysis

2. CIS-PD - Michael J Fox Foundation (MJFF) project with Apple watch and MC10 sensors
All Python notebooks and relevant files should be in the GitHub directory here:
    \\FS2.smpp.local\Lab Members\JoeL\GitHub
`CIS-PD_Curation` directory has the code that Nick and I shared.
`CIS-PD_Curation-kamshee` directory has the code that I worked on.
Ignore the `CIS-PD_Curation2` directory
Nick Shawen should have the updated code in the repo and shared drive.

Notes from last meeting with Ami Drory:
1. Plan for feature engineering before plugging into ML models.
- Interpolate signal in the tmie domain so that each gait cycle is the same 
  length of time.
- If time interpoloation does not work with CVA, then use dynamic time warping (DTW).
- DTW
  - Need to have a constant. One idea is to warp 1 signal and maybe keep the 
    shortest signal constant.
  - It may not matter which is the reference signal.
2. ML model trainnig notes
- Discussed using healthy control (HC) trained model vs. CVA group to determine stage 
    of recovery.
- Discussed using CVA trained model to predict CVA classification/scoring for things 
    like activity recognition.

Other notes:
1. All files should be in my folder. The path is: \\FS2.smpp.local\Lab Members\JoeL
1. The `activity_recognition_process` is an older directory. I changed the name to
`activity_recognition`, and then finally `MC10sensors`.

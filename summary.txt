1. MC10 sensor project for CVA

GitHub repo
https://github.com/kamshee/MC10sensors
`dump` directory - Dumped code here instead of deleting.
    Tested some things like HC01 and HC02 (which had battery issues and 
    missing data), clipping and aggregating functions (later decided we were not 
    going to clip and do sliding windows and get features from them), Andrew Dai's
    code looking at PSD binning for features, 
`meetings` directory - Added notebooks on feature discussion and length of stay (LOS)
    data visualization.
`tests` directory - Included some testing including 131 features from Megan's previous
    paper to compare the results of the features translating Matlab to Python code.
`machinelearning` directory - Examples of simple models (knn, logreg, SVM) using 
    Pipeline objects, hyperparameter tuning with cross validation, splitting train/test
    datasets, scoring, predicting, and reporting. The current plan is to use autosklearn
    to build and test different ML models.

Notes from last meeting with Ami Drory:
1. Plan for feature engineering before plugging into ML models.
- Interpolate signal in the tmie domain so that each gait cycle is the same 
  length of time.
- If time interpoloation does not work with CVA, then use dynamic time warping (DTW).
- DTW
  - Need to have a constant. One idea is to warp 1 signal and maybe keep the 
    shortest signal constant.
  - It may not matter which is the reference signal.
2. ML model trainnig notes
- Discussed using healthy control (HC) trained model vs. CVA group to determine stage 
    of recovery.
- Discussed using CVA trained model to predict CVA classification/scoring for things 
    like activity recognition.
